Proof of Concept DNA storage
======================

SNA is a DNA digital storage encoder/decoder for base2 (binary) to base4 (DNA)

4ROLL method is for encoding Digital information in Biological format

Use this format for encoding, and 'roll' through a table to change the binary to DNA order
00 = A   ->   00 = C ...
01 = C   ->   01 = G ...
10 = G   ->   10 = T ...
11 = T   ->   11 = A ...
1byte = 4bases

Uses hardcoded values. Focus of code is a PoC, not usability or arguments.
(Willing to increase functionality if proven useful)

4ROLL.c uses a hardcode file /tmp/test to encode data
data is printed to stdout

4ROLLdec.c uses a hardcoded file /tmp/test.dec to decode data
data is automatically written to /tmp/output
/tmp/output will be overwritten

COMPILE
===========

gcc -o 4ROLL 4ROLL.c
gcc -o 4ROLLdec 4ROLLdec.c

===========
RUNNING
===========

./4ROLL > /path/to/output.extension
./4ROLLdec (automatically outputs to /tmp/output, can change in code for windows or symlink for *nix based systems)

===========
PROS
===========

-fast
-no libraries or fancy gadgets
-can avoid defined length of repeating homopolymer nucleotides

===========
CONS
===========

-not fully tested
-uses 'garbage' value to compensate for homopolymer repeats
-single nucleotide error means data could not be reliable (possibly 'statically roll' table instead of 'rolling' based on nucleotides? using a data value outside the DNA could also allow for multi-threading)
-proof of concept quality (e.g. code has little error checking, will crash if you don't have enough memory to encode the file you're using)
-may have a size error in decoding (see code. bs_offset not checked for size properly)
