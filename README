Proof of Concept DNA storage


Uses base4 system (number of bases in nucleic acid)

4ROLL method is for encoding Digital information in Biological format

4ROLL.c uses a hardcode file /tmp/test to encode data
data is printed to stdout with printf (ya i know)

4ROLLdec.c uses a hardcoded file /tmp/test.dec to decode data
data is automatically written to /tmp/output
/tmp/output will be overwritten 


there's a method i have for storing Biological data in Digital format
but it is messy and needs cleaning, thus is not on here
basically you use 2bit to encode a base (xNA)
00 = A
01 = C
10 = G
11 = T
1byte = 4bases

hope the code is endian neutral but i can not test it

see comments in code for more info
